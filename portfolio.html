                Is Boris Gone? is a website that me and my friends <a class="link" href="https://thomasr.me">Thomas</a> and <a class="link" href="https://lewisakura.moe">Lewis</a> created to know how long the former Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, had been in office for and if he had resigned. All of the data was pulled automatically from the government's official API.

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Surya Real Estate was created as part of my BTEC course work for Unit 28. The brief required me to create a website for a local real estate agency called Surya. My work was graded distinction.
                <br><br>
                The website is completely dynamic, fetching data from a live MySQL database based apon views, lised date and more. The site also has a user system, allowing users to register and login. Users are able to save properties to come back and view later.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Herobrine! is my remake of an old Hive MC's game-mode that was removed in Java 2. Lobbies contain 13 people, one person of which will become The Herobrine. The Herobrine starts off invisible, but can be seen by a cloud of smoke. It is the survivor's task to collect shards to weaken The Herobrine, and eventually make him visible. The Herobrine must kill all the survivors using his special abilities before the survivors kill him first.
            <br><br>
            The Herobrine is currently being maintained for the <a class="link" href="https://trueog.net">TrueOG</a> network, and can be played there too.
